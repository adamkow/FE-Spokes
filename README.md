# NC News App

Spokes is an app for cyclist to find, match and communicate with other cyclists. We chose this idea because we wanted to practice implementing social features such as adding and accepting friends and messaging. The user will start by creating an account using an email and password, they are then taken to a ‘create profile’ page where they can further personalise their account. Next, the user is taken to a users list which can be filtered by location, age, level of difficulty, type of biking and distance. Users can also send and accept friend requests from other users. Once users are matched, they are able to use the chat feature. Lastly, users are able to to view their own account, edit their details, and delete their account.
